# threejs-boilerplate

Just a simple boilerplate for threejs using webpack.
The based of this boilerplate come from and is largely inspired by Bruno Simon (https://github.com/brunosimon/threejs-template-simple)
As I will certainly modify it along the way, I decided to create my own template, for future project.
