# threejs-boilerplate

Just a boilerplate that I use for all my threejs projects.
The based of this boilerplate come from and is largely inspired by Bruno Simon (https://github.com/brunosimon/threejs-template-simple)
I just modified it to suit my needs.

## Setup
Once cloned:
```bash
npm i
```

To test locally
```bash
npm run dev
```

To generate the production version (output is in the .dist/ folder)
```bash
npm run build
```

Happy coding!
